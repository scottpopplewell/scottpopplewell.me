This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I am a software engineer born and raised in Dallas, Tx with a brief stint in the wonderful, Charlottesville, Virginia. While I absolutely could write a custom blog site in Angular/React/Lit/etc, I would love to [save time and focus on the important things.](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1022837097743319040?lang=en)
